# Wine-Dataset-Exploration-
My goal for this exercise is to improve understanding of modeling techniques. I built a prediction model for the perceived quality for red wines. To do this, I used stepwise regression to select for factors that are most likely to be statistically significant, using a training dataset. I then built a multiple linear regression (MLR) model to predict perceived quality of red wine on my test dataset.
