# Wine-Dataset-Exploration-
My goal of this exercise was to improve my understanding of modeling techniques. To achieve this, I built a prediction model for the perceived quality for red wines. To do this, I used stepwise regression to select for the factors that are most likely to be statistically significant, using the training dataset. From there, I built a multiple linear regression (MLR) model to predict the perceived quality of red wine on my test dataset.
